# My Website is Now Open Source!
## Big News for the Community

I am pleased to announce that my personal website is now fully open to the community! All source code is available on GitHub, and anyone can use it to create their own portfolio website or adapt individual components for their projects.

::tip
All code is available under the MIT license, which means you can freely use it for both personal and commercial projects.

## Why Open Source?

The decision to make my website open source was driven by several factors:

1. **Giving Back to the Community**: I've learned a lot from open source projects and wanted to contribute something back.
2. **Transparency**: I believe in the power of transparency and want to show how my website works under the hood.
3. **Collaboration**: I hope that by opening up my code, others can contribute improvements and new features.
4. **Learning**: This is a great opportunity for beginners to see a real-world project and learn from it.

## How to Use the Code

If you want to use my website as a template for your own project, here's how to get started:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub
2. Install the dependencies
3. Customize the content to fit your needs
4. Deploy to your preferred hosting platform

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd your-repo

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Features You Can Adapt

Here are some interesting components you can use in your projects:

- **Dynamic Blog System**: A simple but effective blog system that uses markdown files for content.
- **Dark/Light Theme Toggle**: A smooth theme switching mechanism that respects user preferences.
- **Responsive Design**: The website looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Various techniques to ensure fast loading times and smooth interactions.

## Technical Stack

The website is built with modern technologies that make it fast, secure, and easy to maintain:

- **Frontend**: Vue.js with Nuxt.js for server-side rendering
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **Content**: Markdown files processed with Nuxt Content
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment with GitHub Actions

## Future Plans

This is just the beginning! I have several features planned for the future:

- Adding a comment system for blog posts
- Implementing a search functionality
- Creating more interactive components
- Improving accessibility features

I'm excited to see how this project evolves with community input!

## Contributing to the Project

I welcome any suggestions for improving the website! If you have ideas or find a bug, feel free to create an issue or submit a pull request.

Let's build something amazing together!
