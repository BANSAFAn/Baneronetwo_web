# 🚨 [Dossier] Brave Browser: Privacy Champion or Ethical Gray Zone?

> TL;DR — Brave claims to be a privacy-first browser, but over the years it's been involved in shady affiliate link schemes, questionable crypto practices, leadership scandals, and even legal battles. Here’s a deep dive into what Brave *says* vs. what they’ve actually done.

## 🔍 Introduction

Brave Software markets itself as the "anti-surveillance" browser, promising users protection from ads, trackers, and invasive data collection. But beneath the PR gloss lies a history of controversies that raise serious questions about its ethics, transparency, and long-term trustworthiness.

Let’s break down the good, the bad, and the ugly of Brave Browser.

## 🛡️ The Good: Real Privacy Features That Work

- **Built-in ad/tracker blocker:** Blocks ~1000 trackers per user daily.
- **HTTPS Everywhere, fingerprint randomization, script blocking.**
- **Open-source codebase:** Allows global scrutiny by security experts.
- **Private-by-default browsing modes.**

For many users, especially those new to digital privacy, Brave makes it easy to protect yourself without installing dozens of extensions.

## 💩 The Bad: Controversies & Missteps

### 1. **2020 Affiliate Link Scandal**
> Brave was caught auto-adding affiliate codes to cryptocurrency URLs (like Coinbase, Gemini, Binance) **without consent**, earning referral fees every time users signed up or made purchases.

- Brave called it a “mistake” and removed the feature after backlash.
- Problem? This is exactly the kind of shady tracking behavior Brave claims to oppose.

### 2. **Tor DNS Leak (2021)**
> Brave’s private browsing mode with Tor integration accidentally leaked DNS queries through users' ISPs instead of routing them securely through the Tor network.

- Fixed quickly, but raised concerns about Brave’s QA process.
- For privacy advocates, this was a major red flag.

### 3. **Crypto Partnerships with Questionable Exchanges**
Brave integrated widgets for crypto exchanges like:
- **FTX** (collapsed amid fraud allegations)
- **Crypto.com** (CMO resigned over insider trading accusations)
- **Gemini** (facing lawsuits over interest account freezes)

Despite FTX’s collapse, Brave never issued a public apology for promoting it.

### 4. **CEO Brendan Eich’s Controversial History**
Eich donated $1,000 to California’s anti-gay marriage Proposition 8 in 2008.

- Became CEO of Mozilla in 2014 → mass protests → resigned within 11 days.
- Now leads Brave, which ironically promotes itself as inclusive and ethical.

This has alienated many LGBTQ+ supporters and progressive users.

## ⚠️ The Ugly: Legal Battles & User Exploitation?

### 1. **News Corp Lawsuit (2025)**
> Brave is being sued by News Corp for scraping content and using AI to summarize articles via Brave Search and Summarizer tools.

- News Corp calls it “piracy,” Brave says it’s fair use.
- Could set a precedent for how AI interacts with copyrighted web content.

### 2. **BAT Rewards System Criticized**
Brave Rewards lets users earn BAT tokens for viewing ads, but:

- Average monthly payout: **$0.40–$1.25**
- Users complain BAT is volatile and hard to cash out
- Unclaimed tips pile up — creators get paid only if they opt in

---

### 3. **Unauthorized Installation of Brave VPN**
In late 2023, users reported Brave silently installing its $9.99/month **Brave Secure VPN** on Windows systems.

- Caused outrage. Brave reversed course after public backlash.
- Reminiscent of shady software bundling tactics.

## 📊 Public Perception: Mixed Reactions

| Source | Sentiment |
|-------|-----------|
| Trustpilot (June 2024) | ⭐ 3.0 / 5 |
| Reddit (r/BraveSoftware) | Mixed — some praise privacy features, others call it “crypto bait-and-switch” |
| GitHub Issues | Frequent reports of bugs, performance issues |

Many users say Brave is great **if you disable the crypto stuff**.

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Brave started with a bold mission: **make privacy accessible and fight Big Tech surveillance.**  
But over time, it’s become clear that Brave also wants to be a **major player in the crypto economy** — and that’s where things get murky.

### ✅ Pros:
- Strong built-in privacy protections
- Open source and transparent
- Fast, modern interface

### ❌ Cons:
- Aggressive crypto monetization
- Leadership controversies
- Spotty track record on transparency

If you want pure privacy, consider alternatives like **Firefox, LibreWolf, or Waterfox**.

If you’re okay with Brave’s crypto angle and can ignore the noise, it’s still one of the best privacy browsers — **but buyer beware.**

💬 What do you think? Is Brave still trustworthy, or just another Big Tech wannabe?
